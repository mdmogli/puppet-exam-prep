[INDEX](../../README.md)

## Overview:
Before requesting a catalog for a managed node Puppet collects system information, called facts, by using the Facter tool. 

Puppet has different types of facts:
- Core facts
- Custom facts
- External facts
- Builtin variables (trusted facts, server facts, agent facts, server variables, and compiler variables.)
